/**
 * @defgroup    drivers_onewire 1-Wire Bus Interface
 * @ingroup     drivers_misc
 * @brief       Generic interface for 1-Wire bus drivers
 *
 * This is RIOT's driver interface for Dallas Semiconductor Corp (now Maxim
 * Integrated) specified 1-Wire Buses. 1-Wire slave device drivers should use it
 * to access the bus (and slave hardware). Drivers implementing 1-Wire bus
 * functionality should expose this functionality via this interface so that
 * slave drivers can operate independent of the bus hardware and its driver.
 *
 * The pseudomodule `onewire_oneslave`, when enabled, permits the assumption
 * that each 1-wire bus instance will only ever have a single slave device
 * connected. This turns calls to acquire and release the bus into noops.
 *
